# Recitation 12 via Github

## The cool way

1. [Download](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and install Github.
2. Start it up. Don't sign in or create an account. You can do this after recitation, but for the interest of time do this anonymously.
3. Click the "Clone in Desktop" button on the right.

## The hard way (For the hardcore)

1. Install Github (same as above)
2. Open the command line
    a. Windows: Run the "Git Shell" program.
    b. Mac: Run "Terminal"
3. From the command line, go to your workspace.
4. Clone the repository with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/camman3d/Recitation-12.git`

## If that doesn't work

Click the "Download ZIP" button on the right.
